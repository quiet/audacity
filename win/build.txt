Instructions for building on Windows.

Fuller instructions that include 
   * Portable Settings
   * Building an Installer
can be found on our wiki at http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Building_On_Windows


1. MSVC 2017: Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017

2. Git: Download and install Git, for example by installing:

  Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  and optionally GitExtensions: http://gitextensions.github.io/

 download and run the .msi installer.  GitExtensions has a GUI interface, includes Git for
 Windows and has a Git bash command line in the bottom panel of the screen.

3. wxWidgets:

 1) Clone wxWidgets and checkout 3.1.1 from the Audacity fork of the 
    wxWidgets project: 
       https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/

    for example, in the git-bash command line
      mkdir ./wxWidgets
      cd ./wxWidgets
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/
      
    IF you forgot the --recurse-submodules, you can correct that later by:
      git submodule update --init

  2) Follow instructions for building at 
    https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/blob/v3.1.1/README-GIT.md
    https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/blob/v3.1.1/docs/msw/install.txt

    DO set WXWIN to the appropriate directory where you installed wxWidgets.
    To do that, open a cmd.exe window, and type: 
       set WXWIN=C:\wxWidgets-3.1.1

    You will be building a dll version with MSVC2017 IDE, so...

    In MSVC 2017 open wx_vc15.sln, and select dll, release.
    Then build.

  3) Having got this far, it is well worth trying out building some wxWidgets
    examples to confirm that building has worked OK

4. Audacity

 1) Clone Audacity from the Audacity GitHub project.
       https://github.com/audacity/audacity/

    for example, in the git-bash command line
      mkdir ./audacity
      cd ./audacity
      git clone https://github.com/audacity/audacity/

    Audacity itself does not use/need git submodules.

  2) in MSVC 2017 open audacity.sln
    Choose Release or Debug.
    Click compile.
