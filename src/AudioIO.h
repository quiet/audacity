 * also invoked to do monitoring and software playthrough. Note that dealing
 * with the two buffers needs some care to ensure that the right things
 * happen for all possible cases.
 * @param inputBuffer Buffer of length framesPerBuffer containing samples
 * from the sound card, or null if not capturing audio. Note that the data
 * type will depend on the format of audio data that was chosen when the
 * stream was created (so could be floats or various integers)
 * @param outputBuffer Uninitialised buffer of length framesPerBuffer which
 * will be sent to the sound card after the callback, or null if not playing
 * audio back.
 * @param framesPerBuffer The length of the playback and recording buffers
 * @param PaStreamCallbackTimeInfo Pointer to PortAudio time information
 * structure, which tells us how long we have been playing / recording
 * @param statusFlags PortAudio stream status flags
 * @param userData pointer to user-defined data structure. Provided for
 * flexibility by PortAudio, but not used by Audacity - the data is stored in
 * the AudioIO class instead.
